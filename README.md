# XML Validator and Transformer
This is a web application built using the Django web framework and several Python libraries such as lxml, xmltodict, and subprocess. The application provides features to validate XML using DTD or XSD and transform XML to JSON and HTML using XSLT. Additionally, the application is capable of transforming XSD to DTD using a Perl script, which requires Perl to be installed on the user's operating system.     
  
## Features   
1. Validate XML using DTD or XSD   
2. Transform XML to JSON    
3. Transform XML to HTML using XSLT   
4. Transform XSD to DTD using Perl script (Perl installation required)   

## Requirements   
The following dependencies are required to run the application:     

- Python 3.x   
- flasx 3.x   
- lxml   
- xmltodict   
Additionally, if you want to use the XSD to DTD transformation feature, Perl must be installed on your operating system.    

## Installation   
To install the application, follow these steps:    
   
Clone the repository:    
```
git clone https://github.com/Baalifatiha/Validator-xml.git  
```
Install the Python dependencies:    
```  
pip install -r requirements.txt    
```  
Install Perl if you want to use the XSD to DTD transformation feature.    

Run the Django development server:      
```   
python manage.py runserver   
```   
Access the application at http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser.
